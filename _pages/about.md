Bio
======
I am a computer scientist with a passion for Generative AI and LLMs. After earning my Ph.D. from the University of Central Florida in December 2022, I've been working as a data scientist at Integral Ad Science. Prior to working at Integral Ad Science, I was a graduate research assistant at CASL at the University of Central Florida. My research interests include Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Deep Learning.
